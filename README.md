### ToDo (in no particular order):

- add content
- ~create 404.html template~
- ~create [errorhandler route](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/errorpages/)~
- I wasn't sure how to test the 404 page, but I'm pretty sure I did it right, you can look at the branch adding_404, and change anything if necessary before merging to master
- make carousel text the same (position, size, etc.) as the jumbotron text.
